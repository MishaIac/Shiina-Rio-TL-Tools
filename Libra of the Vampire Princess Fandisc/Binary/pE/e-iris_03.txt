Aconite is flying over the wasteland. Right now, Iris must be facing off with the goddess figure corrupted by infection force.

According to the information he obtained from the goddess, even if the life force within her is contaminated and transformed into infection force, once she expunges it all she won't be able to generate any new infection force.

In other words, it's going to be a test of endurance; a long, drawn-out battle. While it doesn't change the fact that infection force is troublesome, that area is still filled with clean life force.

And so there is no way Iris will lose. He can feel secure in leaving his back to her.

Because Iris has been containing it at the server area, they'll be able to execute the secret weapon Galega has been preparing. And so Aconite just has to believe in them and work to save as many people as possible.

Aconite, his determination renewed, spots a group down below holding back the smog-like infection force.

"All right! I'll give it a shot. I wanna see how powerful this is, too."


With the big sword entrusted by the goddess figure in his hand, Aconite surrounds his whole body with life force to enhance it, kicks the air with both feet, and heads straight for the target, traveling faster than the speed of sound.

He arrives in less than a few seconds. Keeping the momentum, he runs through the smog, wielding the sword to disperse the infection force. A shock wave accompanied by a detonation follows him immediately after.

After that, Aconite joins up with multiple patrol units, gives instructions to those who have decided to escape the planet, and moves on to the neighboring servers.

On the way, he disperses any encroaching infection force, but he cannot deny that his actions are a mere drop in the bucket.

Then, when he finally reaches the last working server, he's greeted with a facility and subordinates already swallowed up by the infection force.

So now, he fires himself up and gets his life force ready to bombard.

Aconite warily scans their presence. They don't seem to be Enosh's doubles, but....it's clear that this situation doesn't look good for him.

He judges that there's no reason to rush if the lines between the servers have been cut. There is a possibility that Enosh lied to him, but Aconite's hunch is telling him that this isn't the case.


Also, luckily, they are pretty far away from the place where Galega is. Infection force is undoubtedly still flowing out from the contaminated Star Gem in this server, but he has some time to spare.

After regaining his composure, Aconite gets a handle on the situation and considers his next move. What should he do with these Ishua Sect men? There aren't many options.

With that, he gets into a combat stance. "Buying time? It's all the same if I take them all out!"

Who knows if he is indeed thinking something like this, which would have his subordinates at their wits' end if they heard himÅ\it's of little consequence to Aconite, who has no intention of handing over Goddess Arm.

If he were someone like Iris, he probably would have forced the fight much sooner. No, by now Iris would already have laid down a barrage with no questions asked. Aconite is relaxed enough to think about things like this.

There can't be many in this world who are faster than Aconite. As Aconite has guessed, this man appears to specialize in space manipulation.

But knowing this doesn't improve his situation. Rather, the fact Enosh seemed to have no intention of hiding it and easily admitted to it probably means that it doesn't matter to him if his power is identified.

There are nearly one hundred men around him. Probably not all of them have abilities specially tuned for battle, but it's certain that each of them has some sort of power. He can't let his guard down.

Even under these circumstances, Aconite still grins. He doesn't give off the the slightest impression of recklessness or desperation, nor any sign of giving up.

In the midst of this desperate situation, his heart is overflowing with joy.

Around five hundred infection force stones explode before Enosh's eyes.

$A_CHR,150,2,10000,1

Amidst the roar of explosions, Aconite is swallowed up by the cloud of dust and infection force that the bombardment has sent into the air. Even if he has survived that, he can't possibly avoid infection in this density of infection force.

Even Enosh thinks so. Some of his men have inevitably relaxed too.


But is he aware that there's a cheat-level phenomenon that can turn the tides of any attack? People call it...

Aconite gets his big sword ready and wreathes his whole body in life force. He's pulling out all the stops, going full-power mode with no restraints. His hair doesn't grow though.

One of the reasons why he can't usually go all out is his physical strength. If he punches a guy seriously, you'll see some real dirty fireworks.

The results would be way too grisly for Aconite, who has a normal mental constitution.

He doesn't hesitate to kill when absolutely necessary, but that doesn't mean he wants to mercilessly leave behind a pile of corpses.

However, right now in his hand he has this special weapon which, no matter how hard he swings it, cuts up only his opponents' life force.

Aconite is sincerely grateful to the goddess figure who entrusted this sword to him. Although she must have had a wry laugh to herself as the one giving it.

Galega finishes the long communication and sighs. Thanks to the increase in staff, the operation has been proceeding smoothly and a few groups have already successfully escaped from Derniere.

Even if the destination awaiting them is a completely unknown world, once they're here there's no time to ask each of them individually if they're ready for it.

Any naughty boy or girl who causes trouble at this stage will simply be turned into a good boy or girl with no questions asked.

As he looks out at the building in front of him, he sees the crowds of people being good children and lining up obediently.


Multidimensional Space Warp Transfer Device.

As Galega mentioned briefly during the communication, originally this was a disposal facility for industrial waste designated as hazardous.

As the name suggests, the disposal facility is equipped to get rid of this difficult to process waste by warping space and tossing it into the void between worlds also known as "imaginary space".


In theory, it connects to this space where nothing exists...


But Galega and the others learned from the Star Gem that with this device it is possible for them to cross over to planets in other dimensions, also referred to as parallel universes, and they have put their last hope on it.

She's feeling good about her body, which moves really well, but it doesn't last very long.

The enemy is fixed artillery but its durability is extraordinary. Just one hit will cause certain slip damage to Iris and impact the field around her.


If victory is contingent upon a Fabian strategy of holding out for an unknown number of turns, it's likely that her mind will shut down before her body.

While spitting meaningless curses, she lifts her hand with her palm facing outward.

She feels the life force flowing on the planet in the same way she operates the familiars she's deployed. Normally this life force is too thin. But right now, Iris can feel it as if it were an extension of her own body.

She sends her will flowing into the life force she has felt and gives it direction. Thin, gently meandering streams merge into each other and small flows become swelling surges which begin to circle around Iris.

Perhaps sensing a disturbance, thick infection force starts to overflow from the black crystal to attack the surrounding life force. The wall before Iris creaks then collapses.

Sparkling gold life force converges above Iris' head. This is two to the tenth power more than she can normally handle. It's beyond the level her body can endure.

However, that only applies if Iris holds the life force within her body. Now all she needs to do is to simply guide the chaotic life force flowing out of her. The colossal amounts of life force are being condensed.

Because Aconite is here with her. No matter what happens, nothing will be a match for her.

Meanwhile, the sludge has been rapidly increasing in volume. It sends numerous tentacles snaking out to investigate the surroundings. Then, as if spotting them, they all simultaneously turn to Iris and Aconite.

Iris nods as if to say he doesn't need to finish the sentence. She's already fired up and raring to go.

Aconite looks at her trustingly, then spins around at the same time as a mob of tentacles swoops down on them.

Silence falls between the three of them.

An unknown world awaits them on the other side of the gate before them.

They may be able to escape contamination by infection force, but that doesn't mean their safety is guaranteed there.

On the contrary, there is the possibility that an environment even more dangerous than Derniere may be waiting for them.

However, they are not ones to lose their nerve at this point. The time has come.

A world of green spreads out all around them - a sight one couldn't see back in Derniere.

A variety of emotions are running through her. Are these feelings her own or are they coming from something else dwelling within her?

When she ponders this, a single teardrop trickles down her cheek. When she glances beside her, she sees that the same thing is happening to Aconite.

They are not sad. They are not happy. They simply shed their tears in silence, without feeling the need to hold back what is brimming over from within them.

After some time, they wipe away their tears.
